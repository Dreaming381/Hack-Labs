# The Hack Labs

These are research and development projects for the Latios Framework.

If you have stumbled across this repository while exploring the internet, please
explore the other repositories instead. You are **not** supposed to be here.

## Authorized Personnel Only

This repository is intended for Latios Framework **contributors only**. Unity
users, DOTS users, ECS users, and even Latios Framework users which do not
directly contribute to the framework should not be here.

At a recent staff meeting, it was decided that to appease activists, experienced
raccoons who are able to navigate the perils within the labs and don’t cause
trouble or break the rules will be left unharmed by staff. Staff members are
permitted to answer questions posed by these raccoons as long as the rules are
upheld.

For all other intruders, staff members are armed and instructed to eliminate the
intruders on sight.

## No Photography

No photography is permitted without express permission from the owner
(Dreaming381). That means **no gifs, screenshots, or videos** can be taken of
the project and shared online for any reason.

## Property Must Remain on Premises

**No assets** within this repository may be **copied** out of the Hack Labs
without express permission from the owner (Dreaming381), with the following
exceptions:

**Exception 1:** Some assets may be explicitly licensed as CC0 or under other
permissive licenses. These licenses govern the copyability of the assets. If it
is unclear whether an asset is licensed under a specific license, assume it is
not.

**Exception 2:** Code assets (C\#, HLSL, C++, DLLs) may be copied for personal
or commercial use. However, it may not be shared publicly unless it has been
functionally reworked/integrated into a project outside the Hack Labs, in which
case only the form/derivative used outside the Hack Labs may be shared.

**Exception 3:** The version of the Latios Framework included in this
repository, while not an official release, may be used under the Unity Companion
License just like the official release versions.

## Respect Safety Warnings

We have put these restrictions in place due to the dangers present at these
premises. Bad code. Bad art. Bad design. Bad practices. Bad documentation.

Nothing here should be used to evaluate the efficacy of the Latios Framework.

There are two reasons everything is bad here.

First, the Unity ecosystem has been severely destabilized over the past couple
of years, limiting the means we have to operate.

Second, we are severely understaffed, and the staff present are unpaid
volunteers lacking a diverse skillset.

If you believe you can make things less bad and would like to join our cause,
please apply via our [Discord](https://discord.gg/DHraGRkA4n). We are looking
for both individuals to design new facilities and individuals to maintain
existing facilities.

## Letter Codes

-   A – Action Lab, used for prototyping combinations of functionality
-   B – Bug Lab, used for bug and regression testing
-   C – Case Lab, used for development of functionality targeting a very
    specific use case or feature
-   D – Demo Lab, used for constructing showcase works that will eventually be
    introduced to the public
-   E – Extras Lab, used for extra feature snippets to feed to the raccoons, not
    suitable for all productions and with no maintenance guarantees
